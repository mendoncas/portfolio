# Hi, i'm Ricardo! 

I am a DevOps engineer and programmer. I am involved in the development of applications using Spring, Quarkus, and NestJS. I build CI/CD pipelines with
Gitlab CI and ArgoCD on Kubernetes clusters. I have a strong foundation in Linux systems and container creation
with Docker, and I work daily on provisioning applications and services on Kubernetes.

I believe there is value in analyzing and discussing technical subjects through personal, 
experience-focused, lenses. This will dictate the content of my articles, and i hope you find them interesting!
